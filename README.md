# Music Genre Classification
Music genre classification model using deep neural networks and trained on the [GTZAN](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification/activity) genre classification dataset.

Beginning with extensive exploratory data analysis to understand features about audio files such as spectral rolloff, chroma features, zero-crossing rate, etc., we preprocess the [GTZAN](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification/activity) and train a 4 layer DNN with ReLU activations and softmax output.

After training for 100 epochs, the model achieved 90.3% testing accuracy.
